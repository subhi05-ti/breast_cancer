# breast_cancer

 Predicting breast cancer diagnosis (Malignant/Benign) based on the features extracted from cell nuclei images.
📌 Project Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. Early detection significantly increases the chances of successful treatment.
This project uses machine learning algorithms to classify breast tumors as:

 Malignant (cancerous)
 Benign (non-cancerous)
based on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains measurements of cell nuclei present in digitized images of breast mass.

# Source

The dataset is available on kaggle.

# Features of dataset

Each sample contains 30 numerical features, such as:

1.radius mean
2.texture mean
3.perimeter mean
4.area mean
5.smoothness
6.compactness
7.concavity
8.symmetry
9.fractal dimension
…and more

# Target

0 — malignant
1 — benign
